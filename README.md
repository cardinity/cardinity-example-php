### Note on testing 3D-Secure flow

Testing 3D-Secure flow involves redirecting purchase flow to an external website and redirecting back. Therefore, this step requires a public address and does not allow `localhost` addresses. To test full 3D-Secure flow, this application requires a public IP, which can be obtained either via hosting this project publicly or tunneling your local setup using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or similar tunneling software.
